        <h3 class="post-title">Thoughts on Being a Thick White Girl</h3>
        <div class="post-content">
        <p>I've always felt some pressure to be thinner than I am for as long as I can remember. I think every woman has. It sucks that I got the pressure from my parents though, since I got it from every other direction, including myself.</p>
        <p>I do understand a mother wanting her children to be healthy, so that they have an easier time navigating life. But the whole BLM movement that has sparked recently, whether its roots are virtuous or not, have made me reflect about peoples' appearances, concerning weight and health.</p>
        <p>I'm pretty sure I'm a compulsive over-eater. I'm not sure why I am. I suspect minor sexual abuse at a very young age sparking some subconscious method of protection that I'd be using (and feeling trapped by) for the rest of my life. Regardless, it's something that I have to work through in my day-to-day existence. It's something that I need to live with. Losing weight feels like starvation to me. Should I go back to that? Maybe that would be healthier for me in the long run. But there's something seemingly (and actually) dreadful about restricting like that to me. </p>
        <p>Anyways, were someone to look at body weight the same way they looked at race, as a state of being that is uncontrollable rather than a choice, there would definitely be a social stigma around body biases. There already are, to an extent. But I think people woule be more likely to be attracted to a person of a different race rather than a fat person of their own race, as things are currently. I could be wrong though. </p>
        <p>All this to say, what if my mom had viewed my body as part of who I am instead of a character flaw? Would I have felt more secure and self-assured in my body growing up?</p>
        <p>If I had my own kids, would I choose to treat them like thier bodies are not a choice but a state of being, like sex, age, height and race? How would that affect them?</p>
        <p>I am feeling somewhat discouraged in the dating world. I don't like my body and therefore I don't want to share it with anybody else. I don't believe that anybody else would genuinely like it, becasue I genuinely don't. That's harsh on myself, I know.</p>
        <p>And at the same time, I'm using this activity to avoid doing yoga. I'll do yoga during my break.</p>
        <p>These thoughts might all be coming around because I'm on my period. They might be coming around because I'm more seriously thinking about dating again. Or maybe I'll just decide to stay single and have my own little farm by myself... </p>
        <p>I have a feeling there is someone out there for me though. I just wonder if they're also looking for me or if they're the type of person who takes life in stride and just enjoys it. I hope we find each other, either way. And in the mean time, I'm going to try to be more like the latter version of this person, as that's how I'd like to live life. I gotta get a bike.</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">My Neighbor is Drunk Again</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>And she's shouting at everyone else in the apartment building through the courtyard. I shouted at her to stop and she's off her rocker. She just came back at me with a lot of drunken insults.</p>
        <p>I wonder what she saw growing up. I wonder if her parents were normal people and she's just an anomaly. I think the more realistic theory would be that one of her parents behaved like this. Which sucks.</p>
        <p>We're all at a point where we're shouting at her to shut up and she's not doing it. Maybe she'll wear her own voice out.</p>
        <p>In other news, I hung out with Glorybell this afternoon and it was a nice time. She met a guy from Facebook's new dating feature named Johnny. She's happy so I'm happy for her.</p>
        <p>I tried to program this here bloggy blog so that the background of the second post would be cream. So in theory, that would make my first post cream, while this one is this rosy pink. Let's see if this works.</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">Here's to Learning New Things</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I'm <em>pretty <strong>stoked</strong></em> to be learning web development in a somewhat easy, interactive way.</p>
        <p>I give <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> a "Thumbs Up" review so far!</p>
        <p>Not sure if that rule I made just made any difference at all. I think the bigger challenge is to be able to tell whether every other line will truly be gray or if it's every other paragraph section. I'm going to try to write enough to create a few lines in order to test this. If it's every other line, then... I mean I guess somehow the code is smarter than I thought it would be. Let's see.</p>
