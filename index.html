      <h3 class="post-title">My Neighbor is Drunk Again</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>And she's shouting at everyone else in the apartment building through the courtyard. I shouted at her to stop and she's off her rocker. She just came back at me with a lot of drunken insults.</p>
        <p>I wonder what she saw growing up. I wonder if her parents were normal people and she's just an anomaly. I think the more realistic theory would be that one of her parents behaved like this. Which sucks.</p>
        <p>We're all at a point where we're shouting at her to shut up and she's not doing it. Maybe she'll wear her own voice out.</p>
        <p>In other news, I hung out with Glorybell this afternoon and it was a nice time. She met a guy from Facebook's new dating feature named Johnny. She's happy so I'm happy for her.</p>
        <p>I tried to program this here bloggy blog so that the background of the second post would be cream. So in theory, that would make my first post cream, while this one is this rosy pink. Let's see if this works.</p>

      <h3 class="post-title">Here's to Learning New Things</h3>
      <div class="post-content">
        <p>I'm <em>pretty <strong>stoked</strong></em> to be learning web development in a somewhat easy, interactive way.</p>
        <p>I give <a href="https://getmimo.com/">Mimo</a> a "Thumbs Up" review so far!</p>
        <p>Not sure if that rule I made just made any difference at all. I think the bigger challenge is to be able to tell whether every other line will truly be gray or if it's every other paragraph section. I'm going to try to write enough to create a few lines in order to test this. If it's every other line, then... I mean I guess somehow the code is smarter than I thought it would be. Let's see.</p>
